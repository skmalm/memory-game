# Memory Game

Simple card-matching game that tests short-term memory skills. This was built
as a project for Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree.

## How to Play

Click a card to reveal its symbol. Then, click a second card; if it is
a match, you've solved that set. Otherwise, the cards will be hidden and
you'll have to remember where they are. If you find all matches in 13 moves
or less, you'll earn three stars! Between 14-16 moves: two stars. Beyond that,
only one star. Try to get three stars in as short of a time as possible!
